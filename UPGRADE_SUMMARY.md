## Visual Quality Comparison

### 2K Textures (Old)
- 2048 × 1024 pixels
- 2.1 million pixels total
- Good for distant viewing
- Pixelated when zooming in

### 8K Textures (New)  
- 8192 × 4096 pixels
- 33.5 million pixels total
- **16x more detail**
- Excellent for close-up views
- Professional quality
- Future-proof for 8K displays

## What This Means

✅ **Dramatically better surface detail**
- Can zoom in much closer without pixelation
- Surface features like craters clearly visible
- Textures suitable for screenshots and videos

✅ **Professional quality**
- 8K is industry standard for high-quality CGI
- Suitable for 4K and 8K display output
- Ready for VR if needed in future

✅ **Based on real NASA data**
- Mercury: NASA Messenger mission
- Venus: NASA Magellan radar mapping
- Earth: NASA Blue Marble project  
- Mars: NASA Viking/MGS missions
- Jupiter: NASA Cassini/Juno spacecraft
- Saturn: NASA Cassini mission
- Moon: NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter

## Trade-offs

### What We Gained
- 4x resolution increase
- 16x more pixels
- Much better visual quality
- Professional-grade textures

### What It Cost
- +58MB storage (64MB vs 6MB)
- Slightly longer initial load time
- CC BY 4.0 attribution requirement

### Verdict
**Absolutely worth it!** The visual quality improvement is substantial, and 64MB is very reasonable for a modern game. The attribution requirement is simple and fair.

## Usage

The textures are already integrated and working. Just run the game with `cargo run` and enjoy the dramatically improved visuals!
