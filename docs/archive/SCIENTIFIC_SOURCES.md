# Scientific Sources for Resource Generation

This document lists the scientific sources used to validate and correct the resource generation system.

## Primary Sources

### Gas Giants

#### Jupiter
- **NASA Juno Mission** - Atmospheric water content measurements
  - Finding: ~0.25% water by molecule in equatorial atmosphere
  - Source: NASA Solar System Exploration, Juno spacecraft data (2020)
  - URL: https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/findings-from-nasas-juno-update-jupiter-water-mystery/
  - Key point: Water exists as atmospheric vapor under extreme pressure, NOT as mineable solid ice

### Mars

#### Water Ice Reserves
- **Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter** data
  - Total detected ice: 5 million km³ (≈4.6×10^15 metric tons ≈ 4.6×10^9 Mt)
  - Sufficient to cover Mars to 35m depth if melted
  - Northern polar cap: 1.6 million km³
- **Medusae Fossae Formation** deposits
  - 220,000-400,000 km³ (enough for 1.5-2.7m global layer)
- **Sources**:
  - Wikipedia - Water on Mars
  - NASA Astrobiology - Water on Mars: The Story So Far
  - MIT observations of Mars surface ice

### Earth's Moon

#### Polar Water Ice
- **NASA Mini-SAR** instrument on Chandrayaan-1 mission
  - Estimate: At least 600 million metric tons
  - Location: Permanently shadowed craters (40+ craters surveyed)
  - Crater sizes: 2-15 km diameter
  - Range: 100M to 1B metric tons per pole
- **Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO)** data
  - Confirms widespread ice in permanently shadowed regions
- **Sources**:
  - NASA - "NASA Radar Finds Ice Deposits at Moon's North Pole"
  - Physics Today - Water ice estimates for the Moon
  - 2019 study: Thick Ice Deposits Near the Poles of the Moon

### Europa

#### Subsurface Ocean
- **NASA estimates** from multiple missions (Voyager, Galileo, Hubble)
  - Ocean volume: 2-3× all of Earth's oceans combined
  - Mass: 2.6-3.2×10^18 metric tons
  - Ice shell: 15-25 km thick
  - Ocean depth: 60-150 km
- **Sources**:
  - NASA Solar System Exploration - Europa In Depth
  - Scientific models of Europa's interior structure

### Asteroids

#### Spectral Classification and Composition

##### C-Type (Carbonaceous)
- **Spectroscopic studies** of C-complex asteroids
  - Average surface water: ~4.5 wt% (excluding Ceres)
  - Some CM chondrites: up to 10.5 wt%
- **Meteorite analysis** (carbonaceous chondrites)
  - CM chondrites average: ~7 wt% water
- **Sources**:
  - "Water abundance at the surface of C-complex main-belt asteroids" - ScienceDirect
  - ArXiv preprint: Remote water detection in asteroids
  - AZoMining - "Water-Rich Asteroids and Their Mining Significance"

##### S-Type (Silicaceous)
- **Hayabusa mission** sample return from Itokawa
  - Traces of water as hydroxyl in minerals
  - Much less than 1 wt%
- **Sources**:
  - Sample return analysis from JAXA Hayabusa mission
  - JWST studies of asteroid belt ice
  - Asteroid mining research papers

##### M-Type (Metallic)
- **Theoretical models** and remote sensing
  - Presumed remnant cores of differentiated bodies
  - Anhydrous (no water)
  - Primarily nickel-iron composition
- **Sources**:
  - Asteroid mining literature
  - Springer Nature - "Resources from Asteroids and Comets"

## Secondary Sources

### General Planetary Composition
- **Morgan & Anders (1980)** - "Chemical Composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury"
  - JSTOR - Classic reference for planetary elemental abundances
- **USGS-NASA Planetary Geologic Mapping Hub**
  - Planetary Data System
  - Comprehensive geological data

### Venus and Mercury
- **Venus**: Venera and Vega lander data
  - Basaltic surface composition
  - High sulfur content
- **Mercury**: MESSENGER mission data
  - High iron content (large core)
  - Sulfur-rich crust

## Key Findings Applied

1. **Gas giants have NO mineable solid ice**
   - Water exists as atmospheric vapor or high-pressure phases
   - Only atmospheric gas extraction is realistic

2. **Mars has limited water ice reserves**
   - 5 million km³ total, not unlimited
   - Primarily in polar regions and subsurface

3. **Moon has modest water ice deposits**
   - 600 million metric tons in polar craters
   - Not a major water source, but useful for local ISRU

4. **Europa is the water giant**
   - 2-3× Earth's total ocean volume
   - Most water in accessible form in inner solar system (if we can get through the ice)

5. **Asteroid water varies dramatically by type**
   - C-type: 4-7% (most common, 75% of asteroids)
   - S-type: <1% (17% of asteroids)
   - M-type: negligible (8% of asteroids)

## Methodology

Research was conducted using:
1. NASA mission data and press releases
2. Peer-reviewed scientific papers
3. Space agency technical reports
4. Planetary science databases
5. Meteorite analysis studies

All values in the game are based on published scientific estimates, not speculation.

## Updates and Revisions

As new missions return data, these values should be updated:
- **Psyche mission** (2026-2030) - Will provide better data on M-type asteroids
- **Europa Clipper** (2030s) - Will refine Europa ocean estimates
- **Future Mars missions** - May update subsurface ice estimates
- **Artemis program** - Will verify Moon polar ice measurements
