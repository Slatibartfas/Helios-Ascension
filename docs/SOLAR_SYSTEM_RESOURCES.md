- **Challenge**: Water is beneath thick ice crust

#### Io
- **Resources**: Sulfur, silicates, volcanic activity

- **Resources**: Atmospheric hydrogen (low accessibility), trace helium-3
- **Rings**: Primarily water ice particles (96% pure)

### Saturn's Moons

#### Titan
- **Methane Lakes**: 45% abundance, excellent accessibility
- **Nitrogen Atmosphere**: 35% abundance (thicker than Earth's!)
- **Water Ice Crust**: 10% abundance
- **Ammonia**: 8%
- **Notable**: Only moon with substantial atmosphere

#### Enceladus
- **Water Geysers**: 75% abundance, 90% accessibility!

### Uranus & Neptune
- **Type**: Ice giants
- **Atmosphere**: Hydrogen, helium, methane
- **Interior**: High-pressure water, methane, ammonia (not mineable as solid ice)

#### Other KBOs
- **Composition**: Mostly water ice, methane, nitrogen

## Resource Extraction Priorities

### For Water/Life Support
1. **Enceladus** - Active geysers (easiest)
2. **Europa** - Massive ocean (challenging access)
3. **C-type asteroids** - Moderate amounts (4-7%)
4. **Mars** - Polar caps (5M Mt total)
5. **Moon** - Polar craters (600M Mt total)

### For Construction Materials
1. **S-type asteroids** - High silicates/iron, excellent accessibility
2. **Moon** - Accessible regolith
3. **Mars** - Surface minerals

### For Precious Metals
1. **M-type asteroids** - High concentration, fully accessible
2. **Iron-nickel asteroids** - Co-occurrence with precious metals
3. **Psyche** - Largest metallic asteroid

### For Fuel (Hydrogen/Helium-3)
1. **Jupiter/Saturn** - Atmospheric extraction (technically challenging)
2. **Moon** - He-3 from solar wind (very small amounts)
3. **Outer moons** - Hydrogen from water ice

## Mining Accessibility Notes

- **Asteroids**: Best overall - entire body is accessible
- **Moons**: Surface and near-surface accessible (0-100m)
- **Planets**: Surface and crustal resources only (<10km typically)
- **Gas Giants**: Only atmospheric extraction possible
- **Icy Bodies**: Ice is accessible, but deep interiors are not

## Volume Comparison

For perspective on scale:
- **Europa's ocean**: 2-3× all Earth's oceans
- **Mars ice**: About half of Lake Superior
- **Moon ice**: About half of Great Salt Lake
- **Jupiter**: Could fit 1,300 Earths inside
- **All asteroids combined**: Less than 4% of Moon's mass

## Game Balance Notes

These realistic values may require adjusting:
1. Mining efficiency/speed
2. Technology progression
3. Transport costs
4. Refining processes
5. Resource consumption rates

The key is that ratios between bodies remain scientifically accurate, even if absolute rates are adjusted for gameplay.
