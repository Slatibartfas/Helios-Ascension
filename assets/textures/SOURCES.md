# Celestial Body Texture Sources

This document lists the sources for all celestial body textures used in Helios Ascension. All textures are from publicly available sources and are properly licensed for use.

## License Summary

**IMPORTANT**: We prioritize the LEAST restrictive licenses:

1. **NASA Public Domain** (PREFERRED) - No restrictions, no attribution required
   - NASA is a U.S. government agency and most imagery is public domain
   - Can be used for any purpose without permission or attribution
   - Attribution is appreciated but not required

2. **Solar System Scope (CC BY 4.0)** (CURRENTLY USED) - Requires attribution
   - Based on NASA public domain data
   - Requires attribution: "Textures provided by Solar System Scope"
   - Free for commercial and non-commercial use

## Recommendation for Future

**For less restrictive licensing**, download textures directly from NASA sources:
- **NASA 3D Resources**: https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/ (PUBLIC DOMAIN)
- **NASA Image Library**: https://images.nasa.gov/ (PUBLIC DOMAIN)
- **NASA GitHub**: https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources (PUBLIC DOMAIN)
- **USGS Astrogeology**: https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/ (PUBLIC DOMAIN)

These NASA sources provide the **same or better quality** textures with **NO attribution requirements**.

- **OSIRIS-REx** (Bennu) - Public Domain
- Generic rocky/metallic textures - Create procedurally or use NASA imagery

### Comets

For comets, use mission-specific data:
- **ESA Rosetta** (67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko) - Check ESA license
- Generic icy nucleus textures - Create procedurally or use NASA imagery

## How to Switch to NASA Public Domain Textures

To use the **least restrictive license** (NASA Public Domain, no attribution required):

1. Visit https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/
2. Search for the planet or moon you need
3. Download the texture in your preferred resolution
4. Replace the corresponding file in `assets/textures/celestial/`

Alternatively, use the NASA GitHub repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources
# Browse the repository for planetary textures
```

## Attribution Requirements

### Current Setup (Solar System Scope - CC BY 4.0)
If using the provided textures, include this attribution:
```
Textures provided by Solar System Scope (https://www.solarsystemscope.com/)
License: CC BY 4.0
```

### NASA Public Domain Alternative (Recommended)
If you replace with NASA textures:
- **No attribution required** (Public Domain)
- Attribution appreciated but optional: "Imagery courtesy of NASA"

## Notes on Usage

1. **Resolution**: Textures are provided in 1k (1024x512) and 2k (2048x1024) resolutions to balance quality and performance.

2. **Formats**: All textures are in JPEG format for efficient storage and loading.

3. **Mapping**: All textures use equirectangular projection (latitude-longitude mapping) suitable for spherical UV mapping.

4. **Fallback**: Bodies without specific textures use procedurally generated colors based on their physical properties from `solar_system.ron`.

5. **Future Additions**: As new high-quality imagery becomes available from missions, textures can be updated or added.

## Best Practice

**For an open-source MIT-licensed game**, using NASA public domain textures is the best choice:
- ✅ No license conflicts
- ✅ No attribution requirements
- ✅ Same or better quality
- ✅ Directly from the source
- ✅ Free for any use (commercial, non-commercial, modifications)

The Solar System Scope textures are convenient but add an attribution requirement that NASA sources don't have.

## Final Recommendation

**Replace all current textures with NASA public domain versions** from:
- https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/ (PRIMARY)
- https://images.nasa.gov/ (BACKUP)
- https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources (TECHNICAL)
