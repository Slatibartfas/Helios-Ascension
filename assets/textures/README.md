# Celestial Textures - License Information

## Current Status

The textures downloaded by `download_textures.sh` come from **Solar System Scope** and require **CC BY 4.0 attribution**.

## Recommended: Use NASA Public Domain Textures Instead

For **LESS RESTRICTIVE licensing** with **NO attribution requirements**, we recommend downloading textures directly from NASA:

### Why NASA Public Domain is Better

✅ **No attribution required** (Public Domain)  
✅ **No restrictions** on commercial or non-commercial use  
✅ **Same or better quality** (from original source)  
✅ **Perfect for MIT-licensed open source projects**  

### Where to Get NASA Textures

1. **NASA 3D Resources** (PRIMARY): https://science.nasa.gov/3d-resources/
   - Search for "planet name" or "moon name"
   - Download high-resolution textures
   - All are Public Domain

2. **NASA Image Library**: https://images.nasa.gov/
   - Comprehensive search of NASA imagery
   - Filter by "image" type
   - Public Domain

3. **NASA GitHub**: https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources
   - Git clone for easy access
   - Community-maintained
   - Public Domain

### How to Replace Textures

1. Download NASA textures from the sources above
2. Replace files in `assets/textures/celestial/`
3. Keep the same filenames or update paths in `assets/data/solar_system.ron`
4. **No attribution needed!**

## Current Texture Licensing

If you choose to use the provided Solar System Scope textures:

**License**: CC BY 4.0  
**Attribution Required**: Yes  
**Attribution Text**: 
```
Textures provided by Solar System Scope (https://www.solarsystemscope.com/)
```

## Our Recommendation

**For an MIT-licensed game like Helios Ascension**, using NASA public domain textures eliminates any license complexity and provides maximum freedom for users and contributors.

See `SOURCES.md` for detailed information about all texture sources and alternatives.
