# Celestial Textures - High Resolution Version

## Current Status

The textures are now **HIGH RESOLUTION** (8K for major bodies):
- **Resolution**: 8192x4096 for Sun, major planets, and Earth's Moon (vs previous 2048x1024)
- **Size**: 64MB total (vs previous 6MB - a 10x increase!)
- **Quality**: 4x the resolution = 16x more pixels = dramatically better visual quality

## Texture Resolutions

### 8K Textures (8192x4096 pixels)
- **Sun**: 3.6MB
- **Mercury**: 15MB
- **Venus Surface**: 12MB  
- **Earth**: 4.4MB
- **Mars**: 8.1MB
- **Jupiter**: 3.0MB
- **Saturn**: 1.1MB
- **Moon**: 15MB

### 2K Textures (2048x1024 pixels)
- **Venus Atmosphere**: 225KB
- **Uranus**: 76KB (8K not yet available)
- **Neptune**: 236KB (8K not yet available)
- **Pluto**: 16KB
- **Ceres**: 1.1MB
- **Eris**: 1.1MB

### 1K Textures (1024x512 pixels)
- **Jupiter's moons** (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto): ~16KB each
- **Saturn's moons** (Titan, Enceladus, Rhea, Iapetus, Dione, Tethys): ~16KB each

## Why 8K?

8K textures provide:
- ✅ **4x the resolution** of 2K textures
- ✅ **Much better detail** when zooming in
- ✅ **Professional quality** suitable for close-up viewing
- ✅ **Future-proof** for 4K and 8K displays
- ✅ **Still based on real NASA mission data**

## Performance Considerations

- Total size: 64MB (reasonable for modern systems)
- Textures are loaded asynchronously by Bevy's asset system
- May take a few seconds longer to load initially
- Much better visual quality is worth the extra memory

## Alternative: NASA Public Domain Sources

For even less restrictive licensing (no attribution required):

- NASA Image Library: https://images.nasa.gov/

**Note**: Direct NASA sources may not offer 8K resolution for all bodies. Solar System Scope provides convenient high-resolution packages.
