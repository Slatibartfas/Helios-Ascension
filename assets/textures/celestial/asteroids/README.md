# Asteroid Textures

Textures for different asteroid spectral types based on composition.

## Available Textures

- **C-type (Carbonaceous):** `generic_c_type_2k.jpg` - Dark, carbon-rich asteroids
- **S-type (Silicaceous):** `generic_s_type_2k.jpg` - Stony asteroids
- **Ceres:** `ceres_4k.png` - Largest C-type asteroid (dwarf planet)
- **Vesta:** `vesta_4k.png` - Largest V-type asteroid (basaltic)

## Spectral Type Mapping

The game uses these textures based on asteroid classification:
- **C-type:** Most common in outer main belt (~75% of asteroids)
- **S-type:** Common in inner main belt (~17% of asteroids)
- **M-type:** Metal-rich asteroids (procedurally generated)
- **V-type:** Basaltic asteroids from Vesta family (uses Vesta texture)

See `assets/textures/README.md` for complete specifications.
